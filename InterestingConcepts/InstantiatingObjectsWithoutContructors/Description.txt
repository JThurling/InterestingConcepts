Bypassing the main Constructor of the class objects, enabling me to use the methods within the class
without me needing to pass a value to the constructor.
E.G:
I could bypass the constructor if the access modifier is set to private, using:

    Runtime.GetUninitializedObject(typeof(CLASS_NAME)) as CLASS_NAME;

this allows me to access data that would have been blocked otherwise.
